					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
					For this project, the area of focus is Montreal’s Chinatown and its surroundings area. The chosen area of study and its related topic relate to a project I have been involved with, first through URBS 433, and currently, as being extended through an external community project (partially with the Chinatown Working Group).<br><br>Here, I want to explore population data, from the perspective of conserving Chinatown’s cultural identity and heritage, in order to document and visualize this notion of Chinatown as an incomplete community. In short, a socio-demographic analysis framed against the lack of services/amenities in the area, which is magnified by increasing development pressure.<br><br>Steps would include finding the relevant Census Tracts, aggregate data (income, language, household types, etc.) into a new dataframe, creation a function for visualization/mapping that perhaps is interactive in some ways.<br><br><i>The full project from URBS 433 can be viewed by clicking the RSP link at the top of the page.</i>
					</p>

					<h2>Conceptualization of the issue</h2>
					<p>
					If Chinatown functions today as an incomplete community, it is largely due to its long history of planning insensitivity and development leniency, which allowed the incremental suppression of essential services and amenities - notably carved out of the urban fabric through several large redevelopment projects (e.g., Complexe Guy-Favreau). This led to the demolition of many housing blocks, local businesses, groceries, parks, and religious buildings - never to be replaced.<br><br>In addition, land pressure in Chinatown is currently at its pinnacle, hemming the local community to the point of suffocation. In an environment where every parcel of land is fiercely contested, the planning of provision of services requires immediate attention.

						What you are currently seeing is basic text contained inside an html tag called p.
						This webpage contains no JavaScript whatsoever, but you can already see how some elements are responsive by only using CSS.<br>
						<li>Right-click anywhere and click on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Open_the_Inspector" target="_blank">Inspect</a> (it may involve a different step for different web browsers). This is an extremely helpful feature of your web browser!</li>
						<li>This is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" target="_blank">list item</a></li>
						<li>HTML elements are typically stored in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank">divs</a></li>
						<li>Experiment with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size" target="_blank">font-size units</a> px, %, em, calc, etc.</li>
						<li>It is worth reading up on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS grid layout</a> since the current page is structured that way. This is relatively new to CSS and allows you to easily structure webpages without external libraries such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">Flexbox</a>, etc. CSS grid layout may appear complicated to many, so take your time with it.</li>
						<li>I will add more tips and links during the lab based on questions..</li>
						<li>Final note: you don't need to become a pro at this, but be aware that knowing the ins and outs of HTML and CSS is fundamental to basic web design. You can, however, get away with not knowing much if, for example, you are more focused on embedded webmaps, which we will get to next week and which are styled differently. Still, the bones that hold everything together are what you see right in front of you!</li>

						<b>Evaluation:</b> This should be an easy lab since, at minimum, you can basically get away with replacing the text in this website and call it a day! However, 50% of the this lab's evaluation will go to design, this means that (a) your webpage shouldn't contain any glaring errors (e.g. unclosed html tags that don't render properly) (b) your webpage should make sense semantically (i.e. the right html tags are used for the right elements in the overall hierarchy of the page), (c) it should look better than what you were provided with! -->
